To Do:
==========

Event Custom Post Type
============
Meta Fields: 
• Title (textfield)
• Event Date (datepicker or select fields)
• Time (select field)
• URL (http:// textfield)

Home Page (page-home.php)
• Front-end code completed
• Fill in backend logic for 4 latest events (or plugin - use your judgement)

Event Archive (archive-event.php)
• Make layout single column 4 or 6 wide centered (same styling as right column on home page)
• Limit to 15 events
• Paginate using bootstrap style pagination

(Styled with sass. You shouldn't have to add style for this to-do, but if you do add it to shame.css with some notes)
